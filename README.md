#[CHESS](http://marcostagni.com/projects/chess) 

Status: STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS. LOT OF BUGS, NOT STABLE. 
Language: Javascript.
Support Libraries: Three.js, underscore.js, Tween.js, JQuery.js.

Description: This is the classic Chess Game, but players can control their pieces using their own voice. I used the Web Speech Api provided by every modern browser to perform an accurate analysis of player voice, to detect the exact command. This game is completely playable within the browser, and it has been developed using WebGL (thanks to Three.js)
